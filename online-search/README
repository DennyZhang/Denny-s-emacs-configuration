** Problem description
** Feature
#+begin_example
This module enable us to do intelligent search.
- The default behaviour actives as online dictionary. Currently, it's Chinese to English dictionary.
- For different programming lanuages, it enables us to query api from official websites
Currently, we support query for C++, PYTHON, PHP, etc.

There are the ways to display the result: w3m mode and plain text mode.
Normally, we use w3m, displaying result in a *w3m* buffer.
However, w3m is not widely available in Windows OS.
Thus, users to downgrade to plain text, by configure the variable of is-w3m-enable
