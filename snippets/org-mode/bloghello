To break silos and improve availability, DevOps/Ops should be actively collecting useful feedback of prod env maintenance on a regular basis. Enable developers to easily access it and improve feedback loop together as a team effort.

The very first and most important part. *What To Examine, Providing Developers Meaningful Feedback?*

** 1. Fundamental Monitoring Matters At Both OS And Process Level.
Apparently we need to measure the usage of 4 key resources: memory, CPU, disk and network. Sometime OS is fine, just your crucial process suffers. To be on top of this, monitor at process level as well.

** 9. Simulate Prod Env At Reasonable Cost.
The last but not the least. If DevOps can simulate prod env quickly, developers can have a safe playyard to do tests or dryrun patches. Some common obstacles to achieve this:
- Budget concern. We may need to start enough VMs, in order to get a min "prod env".
- Automate to automate. Not only to automate cluster deployment but also data export and import.
- Simulate prod env as much as possible. This would the most difficult part. And it varies across projects.
